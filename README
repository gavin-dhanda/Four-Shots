README Four-Shots

Overview:
  This game was created as a final project for the Harvard CS50 online course. It is written in 
  Lua through the LÃ–VE 2D Game Engine. It is an infinite third person shooter, where the player
  must defend themselves from increasingly powerful waves of enemies, by gliding, jumping, and 
  crouching to manuever across the screen. All music and artwork is original.

How to Run:
  In order to run the program on your Mac device, go to https://love2d.org/ and download the 
  latest version of Love2D and add it to your Applications folder. Download the zip file of this 
  repository to your Desktop. In the terminal, type "/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love 
  ~/desktop/CS50-Four-Shots-main" and the program should run through the Love application.
